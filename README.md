# Tigrinya Abusive Language Detection (TiALD) Dataset

**Tigrinya Abusive Language Dataset (TiALD)** is a large-scale, multi-task benchmark dataset for abusive language detection in the Tigrinya language. It consists of **13,717 YouTube comments** annotated for **abusiveness**, **sentiment**, and **topic** tasks. The dataset includes comments written in both the **Ge’ez script** and prevalent non-standard Latin **transliterations** to mirror real-world usage.

The dataset also includes contextual metadata such as video titles and VLM-generated and LLM-enhanced descriptions of the corresponding video content, enabling context-aware modeling.

> ⚠️ The dataset contains explicit, obscene, and potentially hateful language. It should be used for research purposes only. ⚠️

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: YouTube comments from 51 popular channels in the Tigrinya-speaking community.
- **Scope**: 13,717 human-annotated comments from 7,373 videos with over 1.2 billion cumulative views at the time of collection.
- **Sampling**: Comments selected using an embedding-based semantic expansion strategy from an initial pool of ~4.1 million comments across ~34.5k videos.
- **Paper**: For methodology, baseline results, and task formulation, see the associated paper.

### Tasks and Annotation Schema

TiALD supports multi-task modeling of three complementary tasks abusiveness, sentiment, and topic classification, which in turn has the following classes:

1. **Abusiveness**: Binary (`Abusive`, `Not Abusive`)
2. **Sentiment**: 4-way (`Positive`, `Neutral`, `Negative`, `Mixed`)
3. **Topic**: 5-way (`Political`, `Racial`, `Sexist`, `Religious`, `Other`)

A schematic overview of the dataset tasks and classes is shown below:

_Models are trained and evaluated with comment text only. The TiALD Score is the average of the macro F1 scores across the three tasks. The task-level highest scores for each approach are italicized, and the overall best scores are in bold._

### 2. Performance of Large Language Models on the Abusiveness Detection Task

| Model | | | Comment Only |  |  |  |Video Context + Comment  |  |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|  | | **Zero-shot**  |  | **Few-shot** |  | **Zero-shot** |  | **Few-shot** |
|  | **Acc** | **F1** | **Acc** | **F1** | **Acc** | **F1** | **Acc** | **F1** |
| GPT-4o | **71.50** | **71.05** | 72.17 | 72.06 | **74.72** | **74.70** | 74.67 | 74.53 |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 | 63.89 | 59.20 | **79.33** | **79.31** | 73.00 | 72.02 | **78.56** | **78.21** |

_†LLaMA-3.2 3B produced invalid responses for over 61% of queries in both few-shot settings, mainly due to its limited Tigrinya text understanding._

### Baseline Models Prediction Files

The final prediction files from baselines models reported in the paper can be found under the [`model-predictions`](./model-predictions/) folder.

### Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)

To assess annotation quality, a subset of 900 comments was double-annotated, exact agreement across all tasks in 546 examples and partial disagreement 354 examples.

**Aggregate IAA Scores**:

| Task | Cohen's Kappa | Remark |
|------|-------|--------|
|Abusiveness detection | 0.758 | Substantial agreement |
|Sentiment analysis    | 0.649 | Substantial agreement |
|Topic classification  | 0.603 | Moderate agreement |

**Gold label**: Expert adjudication was used to determine the final label of the test set, enabling a gold-standard evaluation.

### Croissant Metadata for TiALD Dataset

Croissant is an open, standardized metadata format designed to describe machine learning (ML) datasets. Its primary goal is to make datasets easily discoverable, interoperable, and usable across various ML tools, frameworks, and repositories without changing the underlying data files themselves.

The Croissant metadata for TiALD dataset can be found at [TiALD.Croissant.json](./data/TiALD.Croissant.json).

## Usage of TiALD Dataset

### Intended Usage

The dataset is designed to support:

- Research in abusive language detection in low-resource languages
- Context-aware abuse, sentiment, and topic modeling
- Multi-task and transfer learning with digraphic scripts
- Evaluation of multilingual and fine-tuned language models

Researchers and developers should avoid using this dataset for direct moderation or enforcement tasks without human oversight.

### Ethical Considerations

- **Sensitive content**: Contains toxic and offensive language. Use for research purposes only.
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Abuse is context-dependent; annotations were made by native speakers to account for cultural nuance.
- **Bias mitigation**: Data sampling and annotation were carefully designed to minimize reinforcement of stereotypes.
- **Privacy**: All the source content for the dataset is publicly available on YouTube.
- **Respect for expression**: The dataset should not be used for automated censorship without human review.

This research received IRB approval (Ref: KH2022-133) from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and followed all ethical data collection and annotation practices, including informed consent of annotators.

## Evaluation and Computing Metrics

### Model Predictions File Format

Before computing metrics, you need to save models predictions for one or more of the three tasks in TiALD into a JSON file.

For consistency, we recommend saving the predictions into a file with the following format:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "model_name": "<unique model name>",
        "test_date": "<yyyymmdd>",
        "<custom-field>": "<e.g., model type, hyperparams>"
    },
    "abusiveness_predictions": {
        "<cid>": "<Abusive | Not Abusive>"
    },
    "topic_predictions": {
        "<cid>": "<Political | Religious | Sexist | Racial | Other>"
    },
    "sentiment_predictions": {
        "<cid>": "<Positive | Negative | Neutral | Mixed>"
    }
}
```

### Computing Metrics

Given an exising predictions file for the samples in TiALD test set, the `compute_tiald_metrics.py` script can be used to compute all metrics discussed in the paper (task-level and pre-class).

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install scikit-learn datasets
```

Then run the script as follows:

```sh
python compute_tiald_metrics.py \
  --prediction_file <path-to-model-predictions.json> \
  [--output_file <output-file-to-save-results.json> \]
  [--append_metrics <append metrics to the prediction file>]
```

The script automatically loads the TiALD dataset and computes the following metrics:

- Accuracy for each task
- Macro F1 scores for each task
- Per-class precision, recall, and F1 scores

The summary of results is logged to the terminal and can optionally be saved to a detailed JSON file using the `--ooutput_file` flag.

> The aggregate `TiALD Score` reported in the paper is an arthmetic mean of the task-level macro F1 scores.
